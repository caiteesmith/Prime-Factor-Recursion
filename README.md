# Prime-Factor-Recursion
The program prompts user for a number and then calculates the prime factors of that number using recursion.

Description: Create a program which prompts the user for a number.
             The program then calculates the prime factors of that
             number using recursion. Search a given number for a
             factor that divides evenly into it, and then recurse
             with the remaining number after the division.

Prime Number: A whole number greater than 1 that cannot
              be made by multiplying other whole numbers
              Examples: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23

Factorization: Find which prime numbers multiply together
               to make the original number. */
